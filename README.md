# Cultural_Diversity_Impact

The goal of this project is to utilize U.S. Census data to identify the largest metropolitan areas and analyze how cultural diversity impacts the community's educational and healthcare infrastructure. 

Python packages pandas and numpy were applied for data analysis and the matplotlib library was used to visualize the data. 

Data analysis can be found in the `CityDemographics_Working_Cleaning_Notebook.ipynb` and all visualizations are located in the `Visualizations` folder. A complete project overview can be found in the presentation - `diversity_project_final.pptx`
